Given n friends, each one can remain single or can be paired up with some other friend.
Each friend can be paired only once.
Find out the total number of ways in which friends can remain single or can be paired up.

Sample TestCase:

Input:
N=3
Output:
4
Explanation:
{1}, {2}, {3} : all single
{1}, {2,3} : 2 and 3 paired but 1 is single.
{1,2}, {3} : 1 and 2 are paired but 3 is single.
{1,3}, {2} : 1 and 3 are paired but 2 is single.


Idea:
The main idea is we need to start with 1 as base case.
If we want to find for n=4 try to find for n=3 and 
add the total possible ways of adding a person to the group.i.e.,
The nth person has 2 choices.
  1.nth person remains single, we recur 
   for n-1
  2.nth person pairs up with any of the 
   remaining n - 1 persons. We get (n - 1) * f(n - 2).
So Inorder to avoid calculating previous values everytime ,
store them in a vector and access them wherever we need.
